# Azure Periodic Table

The Azure Periodic Table is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This application serves as an interactive and intuitive way to explore Azure resources. It offers details about each service, their naming restrictions and conventions, and provides useful code snippets in Terraform. Whether you are new to Azure or an experienced user, this project aims to be a helpful reference for managing and provisioning Azure resources.

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js (v12.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher) or Yarn (v1.22.0 or higher)

If you don't have Yarn installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the official [Yarn website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), or install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

## Installation

## Getting Started

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
